Executive Summary



This project would like to look into housing affordability vs. job growth within the United States, particularly what regions experienced the largest change as compared to previous historical averages. This will examine historical data for the years 2000-2010 as compared to 2011-2020. 

For housing data I’d like to use the Housing Price Index Datasets from the Federal Housing Finance Agency. This data begins in 1975 and would have to be adjusted to accurately assess the change in housing affordability over the periods of time. Additionally, the data will need to be adjusted to meet the criteria of focusing on 10 regions by first digit of zip code. 

For employment growth I’d like to use the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics State and Metro Area Employment, Hours, & Earnings. I would like to focus on the Total Nonfarm work growth. A challenge presented by this data is I would have to access each state separately then join the state based off the regions of first digit of zip code. 

Motivation

Home ownership has become increasingly unattainable and while job growth is occurring it has not kept pace with pricing increases. Areas like Nashville, Tennessee or 
Huntsville, Alabama have experienced good job growth and are appealing to those looking for affordable housing. But job growth does not guarantee more housing and might be causing a lack of affordable housing in these areas. 

Data Question

A housing shortage is a well-known issue within the United States. Comparing these two datasets could show what relationship (if any) exists between job growth and affordable housing as well as see what regions have had the most significant changes in the past 10 years. The expected finding is an inverse relationship between job growth and affordable housing. 

1. What regions experienced the largest change in work growth and HPI?
2. What regions experiences the largest change in work growth and HPI as compared to their previous 10 years? 
3. What relationship exists between Nonfarm work growth and HPI?
4. How do states within the region with the largest work growth compare to each other?

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The final product should include:
* Maps showing regional change in Total Nonfarm work growth for years 2011-2020 as compared to average change from years 2000-2010. 
* Maps showing regional Housing Price Index (HPI) changes for years 2011-2020 as compared to average change from years 2000-2010
* Line charts by region exploring the changes in work growth vs. the changes in housing prices
* Tables/bar charts examining and comparing the states that experienced the largest combined Total Nonfarm work growth on average for the years 2010-2020  

The intended audience includes:
* Companies examining what regions to invest resources
* Housing construction companies
* Real estate investors
* Households considering relocation
